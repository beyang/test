# Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hookâ€™s standard input with lines of the form:
#
# <local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF
# For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were run the hook would receive a line
# like the following:
#
# refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
#
# although the full, 40-character SHA-1s would be supplied. If the foreign ref does not yet exist
# the <remote SHA-1> will be 40 0. If a ref is to be deleted, the <local ref> will be supplied as
# (delete) and the <local SHA-1> will be 40 0. If the local commit was specified by something other
# than a name which could be expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA-1) it will be supplied as it was
# originally given.
